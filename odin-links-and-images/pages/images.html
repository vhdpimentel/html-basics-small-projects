        <h1>Images</h1>
        <p>This page includes different image formats</p>
        <h2>JPGs</h2>
        <p>JPGs are good for photos, as they have good colors and are light, but they don't offer transparent pixels</p>
        <img src="../images/mochi.jpg" alt="a mochi JPG" width="75"> <!-- Here I am setting image
        widths to match the SVG's displayed size, but I guess I won't do it like this  after I learn CSS -->
        <h2>GIFs</h2>
        <p>GIF images are good for simple animations, but don't have a limited color palette</p>
        <img src="../images/mochi.gif" alt="a jumping mochi GIF" width="75">
        <h2>PNGs</h2>
        <p>PNG images are good for icons, logos, etc, since they offer transparent pixels and have a varied color palette</p>
        <img src="../images/mochi.png" alt="a mochi PNG" width="75">
        <h2>SVGs</h2>
        <p>SVG images are made of vectors instead of pixels, so they can be scaled up or down depending on the device.</p>
